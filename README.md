Keep-It-Up: Keep Your Backend Up 🔥

Ever hit a URL for your personal project or demo app and had to wait... and wait... for it to load? 😫 That's a "cold start" and it happens when free-tier hosting services like Render put your server to sleep to save resources. Stay-Alive is the simple, free, and clever solution to keep your app awake and ready for action! 🚀

The Problem: The Cold Start 🥶

When your backend isn't used for a while, hosting providers might spin it down. The next time someone visits, the server has to wake up, which causes a frustrating delay.

Keep-It-Up is here to fix that! ✨

How It Works: The Smart Ping 💡
This project uses a lightweight serverless function on Vercel to send a periodic "ping" to your backend. It’s like a little digital alarm clock that goes off every few minutes, telling your server: "Hey, don't go to sleep just yet! People are coming!" 😉
Because Vercel's free tier includes serverless functions, you can get a faster, more reliable experience for your users without spending a dime. It's the perfect solution for:
 * Personal projects and portfolios 🧑‍💻
 * Demos and prototypes 🧪
 * Learning apps and passion projects 📚

Get Started in 3 Easy Steps! 👇

1. Fork and Deploy 🚀
Start by forking this repository and connecting it to your Vercel account. Vercel's dashboard makes it super easy to deploy directly from your GitHub repo.
2. Set Your Environment Variables ⚙️
In your Vercel project settings, head over to the Environment Variables section and add these keys:
 * BACKEND_URL: The full URL of your backend service (e.g., your Render app's URL). This is the destination for the pings. 🎯
 * PING_INTERVAL: (Optional) The interval in minutes between each ping. The default is 10 minutes. Set it to whatever works best for you! ⏰
3. All Set! 🎉

That's it! Vercel will automatically run your function, and your backend will stay warm and ready to serve your users instantly. Say goodbye to cold starts forever! 👋
